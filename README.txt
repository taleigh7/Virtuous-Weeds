Okay. Here's the deal. 
I was just cleaning up the pages, lining things up and such, when things stopped working.
So my project is going to be a more limited one!
I was already in a hurry and now I don't know if I will make it.

I've pulled a previously saved version which isn't laid out well. 
My main project page will be a linked page of the index.html.
So open index.html.
Open the dropdown menu by hovering over "stories" in the main navbar at the top of the page.
Click on the first story, "No Worries, we are monkeys, we are stardust, we are golden!" 

	This name is making me laugh so hard under the circumstances that it is hard to type!

The site is a blog. Some features are:
--dropdown menu for stories list (but only "No Worries!" works now.)
--sticky navbar on scroll in mobile mode. THIS IS MY JAVASCRIPT.
--3D Cards at the bottom of the "No Worries!"... aka Universe page.
--Had planned to include form page and other animated features that included use of the random number function,
  but I got so tied up in doing and redoing the layout 
  (this I need work on! I have trouble making it look good at some widths)

  If I were doing the project over again, I would spend less time on general layout and more time on 
  the javaScript side. 


REGARDING FONTS:
The pages look terrible without using the google FONTS that I have downloaded and included in the project directory.
Risky perhaps. But should work.

NOTE: Sometimes you have to go through the index.html to the "No Worries!" page to get the fonts to work. 

It almost always works in Firefox. If it doesn't work in Chrome, switch back and forth 
between VW-home and Stories-"No Worries!"

REGARDING LINKS:
The stories links and extra content links that I added are not currently in this old version, 
and I  probably won't have time before 12 to put them back in.

REGARDING CLEAN MARKUP PAGES
I probably won't have time to clean them up again. I'll push the pages up first. If time I'll clean them up.

REGARDING REST:
Will add more to readme after.
